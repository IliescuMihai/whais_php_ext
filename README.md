# Whais PHP Ext

htttp://www.whais.net (to be available in the next days)

This project is a simple extension to facilitate users of PHP (version 7.2.6 and higher) interact with a Whais server. 

This extension is very much work in progress. It does provide the basic functionalty to connect to a Whais database server, execute procedures and fetch results. However, its functionality was tested in a limited way. 

## Instalation

To use this module, it has to be built from source code. It is developed for PHP version 7.2.6 and newer. The module is relying also an the Whaisâ€™ C client library in order to function. The build of this module is done as any other PHP module. Please refer to PHP documentation how to properly use the commands bellow: 

```
git clone git@github.com:iulianpopa1981/whais_php_ext.git 

phpzie 

./configure 

make 

make install 
```

Also, please make sure to update the config.m4 file after clonning this so to properly point to the location of the Whais client library.
